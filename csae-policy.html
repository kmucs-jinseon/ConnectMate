            <h1>Connect Mate Standards Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h1>
            <p class="meta">Last updated: 2025-12-03</p>

            <h2>1. Our zero-tolerance policy</h2>
            <p>
                Connect Mate strictly prohibits any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). We have a
                zero-tolerance approach toward:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creation, sharing, or storage of child sexual abuse material (CSAM)</li>
                <li>Sexualization of minors in text, images, videos, or audio</li>
                <li>Grooming or any attempt to exploit or endanger minors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any violation may result in immediate account suspension or termination and reporting to relevant
                authorities.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Prohibited content and behavior</h2>
            <p>The following are strictly forbidden on Connect Mate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uploading, sharing, or linking to any content that depicts or describes sexual abuse or exploitation of minors</li>
                <li>Requesting, soliciting, or exchanging sexual content involving minors</li>
                <li>Grooming behavior, including attempts to gain a minor’s trust for sexual purposes</li>
                <li>Any romantic or sexual targeting of users identified or reasonably believed to be minors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Reporting and user tools</h2>
            <p>
                We encourage all users to help keep Connect Mate safe by reporting suspicious or harmful behavior.
                Users can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Report profiles, activities, chat messages, or images that may involve CSAE</li>
                <li>Block users who behave inappropriately</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Reports are reviewed by our team, and appropriate action is taken in line with this policy and applicable
                law.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Moderation and enforcement</h2>
            <p>
                When we receive a report or detect behavior that may relate to CSAE, we may:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review reported content and associated accounts</li>
                <li>Restrict features, suspend, or permanently terminate accounts</li>
                <li>Preserve and, where required by law, share relevant information with law enforcement or other competent authorities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We cooperate with law enforcement and follow applicable legal requirements when handling
                CSAE-related incidents.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Protection of minors</h2>
            <p>
                Connect Mate is designed for adults and is not intended for use by children. Where age restrictions apply
                under local law, users must meet the minimum age requirement to create an account.
            </p>
            <p>We take steps to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discourage misrepresentation of age</li>
                <li>Act on reports of underage users or users targeting minors</li>
                <li>Remove accounts and content that violate our policies</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Use of images and media</h2>
            <p>We do not allow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any image or video that depicts or suggests sexual abuse or exploitation of minors</li>
                <li>Manipulated or AI-generated content involving minors in sexual contexts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If such content is detected or reported, it will be removed and the associated accounts may be suspended
                or terminated.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Continuous improvement</h2>
            <p>
                We review and update these standards as laws, regulations, and industry best practices evolve.
                Our goal is to maintain a platform that is safe, respectful, and free from child sexual abuse and exploitation.
            </p>
